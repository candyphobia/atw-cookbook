# Taco rice - タコライス

Taco rice really sums up Okinawa in a way. A dish formed from the fusion of the American influence on the island is a perfect showcase of how flexible Japanese food culture can be: Appropriate the flavours of something incredibly foreign - like readymade tex-mex spice mixes - and take some of the stereotypical elements of the dish - like pico de gallo and american cheese - creating something that both feels like an incredibly earnest take and a mockery of its orgins. But integrally Japanese. This is an attempt to get close to the version served to us at Nagos tiniest taco rice shop KAZUTAKO, filled with manga and anime figurines and a young man behind the counter trying hard not to stare while two gaijin stuff their faces with this simple but surprisingly delicious Okinawan specialty.

First make the spice paste. In a food processor, make a smooth blend of shallots, ginger, dried red chilies, lemongrass and garlic cloves. If you are able to find galangal where you are at, use that as well. If not, add some extra ginger or maybe even turmeric root.

Cut your beef into a little larger than bite sized chunks. Toast grated coconut on a dry frying pan until it gets a bit of colour and smells toasty.

Heat the oil in an ovenproof pot on high heat. Add the spice paste, spices (cinnamon, cloves, anise, cardamom) and a stalk of lemongrass gently crushed. Cook these until fragrant, a couple of minutes should do. If your spices feel less than fragrant or fresh, you can readily add to these amounts especially if the spices have been imported from far away.

Add the beef into the pot, mix well with the spices. Add one can of coconut milk, an equal amount of water, tamarind paste and lower the heat to a middle heat. Let cook until the meat is cooked, around 10 minutes. Add the toasted coconut, lime leaves and sugar and place in an oven around 150 degrees to slowly cook and reduce.

The stew is good to eat after around 1.5h of cooking without a lid, but definitely doesn’t hurt to cook longer. Proper rendang should be almost dry, but wet rendang is a dish in and of itself also called kalio. So if you are too hungry to wait just take it out earlier. But you really should leave it for as long as you can - the taste will be even better when cooled down and let rest for the night.

Serve with some nice rice (like nasi lemak) and sambal from the Indonesia section if you want it extra spicy.
