# Sambal

Sambal simply means chili sauce in Indonesian. The very basic form is Sambal Ulek, which translates into crushed chili sauce - simple enough. But there’s an endless variety of things you could add to a chili sauce to really make it your own. While sambal was definitely a thing in Malaysia, during our lightning quick stop by over to Indonesia even a short visit to a simple fried chicken restaurant made it clear, that the development of your own blend of sambal is a true point of pride in that side of the bay. So here’s our take - particularly inspired by the nice, incredibly sambal enthousiastic guy at the unnamed chicken place that let us escape from resort food in Bintan.

The first, and most important part is making sure you get the spiciness you want out of your chilies. Sambal does not need to be really spicy to be really delicious - in Indonesia medium hot chilies called Lombok are the most common variety used. If you want more spicy, you could try Rawit or Cayenne peppers.

Start by slicing and deseeding your chilies. You can include some seeds for spice if you have a good enough food processor. 

Measure the amount of chilies you have, and measure around half of that in garlic, peel and gently crush the cloves.

Place the chilies and garlic in a food processor. Add some rice vinegar and salt to taste: Enough to get some of the flavor but not too much, around a teaspoon per cup of solids is a ballpark to start with for the vinegar and about half of that for salt. 

But really it’s all about how you want it to taste at this point.
