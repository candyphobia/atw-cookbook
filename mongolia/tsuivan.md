# Tsuivan

Tsuivan is a straight up nice, hot bowl of fresh noodles, and not much else. According to the guy driving us around Terelj, this is the main sustenance for most working class people – a bowl of this for lunch will keep you full of calories for the whole day. Our version is inspired by the best vegan restaurant in Ulanbaatar, Luna Blanca, and mongolfood.info.

## Noodles

Mix the water and flour into a ball and let it rest while you prepare the other ingredients.

Split the dough into even pieces and roll them out into thin round sheets that fit onto your frying pan. Spread vegetable oil onto the surface of one of the sheets and place another sheet on top of it. Repeat for all sheets.

Add a little oil onto the top sheet and flip onto a frying pan on low heat. Warm on one side for a few minutes, repeat on the other side. The goal is not to fry the sheets, but to dry the surface. A little color is fine.

Remove the sheet from the pan and cut it into strips the width you prefer your noodles. Repeat this with the rest of the dough.

## Stew

Cut your vegetables into narrow stripes. The carrot, onion and cabbage are essential but you can freestyle with anything you would like to add – sweet bell peppers are a nice addition when in season.

Rehydrate the soy protein according to the instructions of the product.

In a large, preferrably thick-bottomed pot, sauté the onion in vegetable oil. Add the carrot and any other hard vegetables that require a longer time. After a minute or two, add the soy protein – add vegetable oil if things get sticky. Add the garlic, bell pepper and chili, season with black pepper and salt or soy sauce.

Add the cabbage, mix and cook until the cabbage has clearly lost some volume.

Add water to halfway up the vegetables, add the noodle strips on top and cook with the lid on for 15 minutes. Check that the noodles are done by taking a chopstick or fork and separating the noodles. If the noodles easily separate, they are done.

Remove the pot from heat and mix everything together. For seasoning, add a dash of soy sauce.
