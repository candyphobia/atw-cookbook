# Uzbek Lagman soup

Hungry in Yekaterinburg, waiting for a train to arrive we stopped at a place called Nigora mainly because it seemed to have a lot of traffic in front of it and a lovely smell around it. We order a bunch of things in the haze of hunger, one of those an absolutely amazing bowl of fresh noodles in a hearty broth. Once consciousness slowly is regained the search begins - what is this delicous soup? Turns out, it was a lovely rendition of Uzbek lagman or lagmon. The Uzbek rendition is more of a soup or stew, while over the border in China the Uyghurs make theirs more in the way of a stir fry with the same basic set of noodles & ingredients. I’m sure that version would be delicious as well.

To cook the authentic lagman Uzbek soup, the recipe advises to take a thick-walled kettle. The skillet or cast iron pan with high sides will be suitable. You should kindle the animal fat, fry the meat, subculture the onion, adding here the garlic, bell peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, potatoes and radish. Preferably if you cut all uniformly on cubes, because Uzbek noodle soup lagman is not only delicious, but also a beautiful dish. When the gravy ingredients are brown you should fill it with water, bring to a boil. Add the spices: star anise (or anisetree) - certainly, cumin, red pepper, kinza (coriander), salt and other spices to taste. Add the cabbage. The gravy for Uzbek lagman you should simmer over low heat until readiness.

While the gravy for our Uzbek lagman is quenched, we will pull the dough for noodles. The dough is smeared with a solution of salt and baking soda diluted in water, punched to absorb the solution. Small pieces of dough are rolled into the form of pencils. Each such "pencil" is oiled and stretched to about a meter. To do this, the wiring is taken at both ends and stretched mid hitting the table. The meter of noodles is folded in half and the stretching is repeating.
