# Gà kho gừng - Ginger chicken
Typically we found this dish made out of chicken, hence the name (Gà = chicken, kho = to simmer, gừng = ginger). But our version uses firm tofu instead, chicken stock replaced with vegetable stock and fish sauce replaced with Nước mắm Chay - a vegan option based on fermented soy.

> Ingredients
> - 500g tofu
> - 2 tbsp white sugar
> - 2 tsp black pepper
> - 1 vegetable stock cube
> - 2 tbsp Nước mắm Chay
> - 3 small shallots
> - an inch of ginger
> - 3 cloves of garlic
> - 2 tbsp Nước màu
> - Vegetable oil for frying

First press and dry the tofu a bit. Cut into suitable sized cubes and leave to marinate for 30-60 min with the Nước mắm Chay, vegetable stock, black pepper and white sugar. If I have extra limes at home I might add the juice of one as well.

Prepare shallots, ginger and garlic - there should be close to equal amounts of the three. Heat vegetable oil on a pan, and first throw in the shallots, fry for 30 seconds. Then add the garlic, another 30 seconds and finally the ginger. Fry until the shallot is starting to get a bit of colour. Add the tofu, with all of its marinade. Cook until the sugar in the marinade is dissolved, around 5 minutes on medium heat. Add the Nước màu and keep cooking for another 5 minutes. Serve with papaya salad and sticky rice for a quick and delicious meal.

## Nước màu - Caramel sauce
> Ingredients
> - 1 cup granulated white sugar
> - 1/4 cup water + 1/2 cup water

In a pan, heat up 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water until sugar starts breaking down and changing color to a dark amber (this might smoke a bit!). Turn off heat, and very carefully add 1/2 cup of water into the pan - this will instantly boil and sputter, so be extremely careful. Mix the sugar and water and once cooled pour into a glass container.
